How to make a theme for Karaokivy
=================================

1. Grab the source of the default theme.
2. Replace the images with your custom ones.
3. Using a command line, run the following command:

$ python -m kivy.atlas <themename> <size> <list of images> 

You should also create a "manifest.json" with the theme info
and "theme.json" with the previously created atlas and the
colors.
